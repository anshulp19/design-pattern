Command design pattern is used to implement loose coupling in a request-response model.

The invoker is decoupled from the action performed by the receiver.
The invoker has no knowledge of the receiver. The invoker invokes a command,
and the command executes the appropriate action of the receiver. Thus, the invoker can invoke commands without
knowing the details of the action to be performed.
